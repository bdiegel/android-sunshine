Anrdoid Study Jam 

Instructor: Evan Halley
Wifi: Welcome!

Week 1
------
Layouts: Linear, Frame, Relative
ListAdapter: binds data to ListView
- list item layout for elements
- view recycling
  - view are reused as they scroll offscreen
  - the view is reused and layout is alread inflated
  - other views (like grid) recycle
- google material guidelines
  - advocates using a recycler view
	RecyclerView.Adapter
  - separates creating the view and binding data
  - similar to the cursoradapter
    - newView - view inflation
    - bindView


View holder pattern?
- literally a container that holds references to your views

Questions:

minSdkkVersion
targetSdkVersion
compatibility library


Week 2
------
- web apis & http requests
- logcat
- main vs background thread
- menus
- permssions
- json parsing

- Android recommends HttpUrlConnection
- note: extra work involved with https + self-signed certificate
- OkHTTP

- Android attempts to render UI at 60fps (every 16.67ms)
  if it can't -> jitter
- tools reviewed for debugging ui performance:
  http://www.curious-creature.com/docs/android-performance-case-study-1.html
  - Developer Options: 
    Profile GPU rendering: on screen as bars || dump 

- AsyncTask<Params, Progress, Result>
  doInBackground(Params...) <- array of your objects 
- should use a Service for this?
- AsyncTasks run in serial (they block other async tasks)
- can be called in parallel:
  task.executeOnExecutor(Executor exec, String)
  task.executeOnExecutor(AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR, ...

Permissions
- requests defined in Android manifest: <uses-permission
  
Android Studio shortcuts and tips
- Generate menu: ALT+Ins (linux)
- CTRL+B: Go to declaration (from resource id to resource xml file)
- developer options: show touches, show cpu usage
  profile gpu rendering
  debug gpu overdraw - show wasted resources

Open Weather API
- use: q=<zipcode>,usa

Questions:
  do you use 3rd libs like retrofit (square) + gson?


Week 3
------
New Activities & Intents
- click listeners, toasts, creating and starting activities
- prefs, intents, broadcast recv

Intents
- explicit (specifies Activity) 
- implicit (by action)
  new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND)
- intents can carry data
  intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, message)
- URIs used 
- intent types: HTTP.PLAIN_TEXT
- startActivity(intent), startService(..), sendBroadcast(..
- apps declare intent-filters to define types of intents they handle

Preferences
- xml/prefs_general.xml
- SettingsActivity
- stored in SharedPreferences object
- written to file in apps private storage
  /data/data/<app>/shared_prefs
  the database files are also here
- recommended now to use PreferenceFragment (instead of Activity)
- can have dependencies in the xml using the 'key' of another pref
- setShareHistoryFileName <- to remember the user choice

- recommendations for low-fidelity wireframe tools
- are google apps open source
